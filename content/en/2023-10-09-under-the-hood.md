## Bye bye Wordpress...

I have been using [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org) for almost 20 years now. I've used it for my [old blog](https://lostinbrittany.org/blog), I've used it for corporate blogs including the current [OVHcloud blog](https://blog.ovhcloud.com), I've used it for countless blogs for friends, family and associations. 

During those years I have come to understand (never to master...) the arcanes of the platform, I am able to run it, configure it, administer it, and even to create themes and plugins. Yet it seemed me overkill for this new blog. 

Then I realized that, for the last years, I have been creating more and more blogs based on static site generators than on Wordpress. For almost all my side projects, including the site for [Le Camping des Speakers](https://camping-speakers.fr), I have used [Eleventy](https://11ty.org) as generator.
