abstract: "<p>In this interactive workshop, we’ll immerse ourselves in the exciting world of HTMX 2.0, the latest evolution of HTMX, designed to streamline and enhance frontend development. Participants will get hands-on experience with the newest features released in HTMX 2.0, working through practical exercises that highlight its powerful capabilities.\nWe’ll then shift gears to explore Web Components, the building blocks for creating reusable, encapsulated HTML tags. You’ll have the opportunity to build your own Web Components using Lit, a lightweight and efficient library. Through guided coding sessions, you’ll create simple Lit elements, illustrating how it simplifies the development of dynamic and complex web components.\nThe core of our workshop will focus on the seamless integration of HTMX 2.0 with Web Components. You’ll actively combine HTMX with Lit, extending the functionality and efficiency of both tools to build robust, modular, and maintainable web applications. Through a series of collaborative coding exercises and real-time problem-solving, you’ll experience firsthand how HTMX 2.0 and Lit together provide a perfect synergy for modern frontend development.\nBy the end of this hands-on session, you’ll have created your own mini-project showcasing the power of HTMX 2.0 and Web Components, leaving with practical skills you can immediately apply to your development work.</p>"
