Large language models (LLMs) are transforming software development, and Java developers are no exception. But how can we go beyond simple API calls and deeply integrate LLMs into our applications?

In this talk, we’ll explore the different types of LLMs—closed-source, open-source, and locally hosted models—before diving into how Java developers can harness them effectively. We’ll focus on LangChain4J, a powerful framework that simplifies LLM integration in Java, and discuss how LLMs can interact with existing Java applications and data through tool calling and function execution.

A key part of this evolution is Model Context Protocol (MCP), an emerging standard for LLM integration. We’ll break down its role in bridging LLMs with real-world applications and demonstrate how to build an MCP server using Quarkus—from setup to practical use cases.

If you’re a Java developer looking to integrate LLMs efficiently and take advantage of emerging standards like MCP, this talk will provide the insights and code to get started.
