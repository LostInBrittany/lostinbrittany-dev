This workshop dives into htmx 2.0, offering hands-on experience to streamline frontend development. You’ll explore its latest features through live coding and interactive exercises, starting with a quick introduction to its core functionality and new updates. Practical examples and real code snippets will show how htmx simplifies common frontend tasks.

Next, you’ll learn to create reusable Web Components using the Lit library, with a guided exercise to build a simple Lit element and integrate it into a project.

In the second half, we’ll focus on combining htmx and Lit Web Components, using step-by-step examples to build modular, maintainable components with minimal JavaScript. By the end, you’ll understand how these tools complement each other and gain the confidence to apply them in your own projects.
