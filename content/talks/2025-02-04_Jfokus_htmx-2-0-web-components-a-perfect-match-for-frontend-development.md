In this Tools in Action session, we’ll dive into the exciting world of htmx 2.0, the latest evolution of htmx, designed to streamline and enhance frontend development. We’ll explore the newest features released with htmx 2.0, showcasing code snippets that highlight its powerful capabilities.

Next, we’ll revisit the concept of Web Components, the building blocks for creating reusable, encapsulated HTML tags, and introduce you to my favorite Web Component library, Lit. By demonstrating a simple Lit element, we’ll illustrate how it simplifies the creation of dynamic and complex web components.

The core of the session will focus on the seamless integration of htmx 2.0 with Web Components. We’ll show how combining htmx with Lit extends the functionality and efficiency of both tools, making it easier to build robust, modular, and maintainable web applications. Through practical examples, you’ll see firsthand how htmx 2.0 and Lit together provide a perfect synergy for modern frontend development.
